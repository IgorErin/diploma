\section{Terms}

wait freedom: each thread moves forward regardless of external factors like contention from other threads, other thread blocking
lock freedom: system as a whole moves forward regardless of anything
obstruction-freedom: thread makes forward progress only if it does not encounter contention from other threads
    - blocked/interrupted/terminated threads can not prevent progress of other threads
    - obstruction-free algorithms can be faster than lockfree algorithms
termination-safety: terminated thread does not prevent system-wide forward progress
blocking: allow a slow or delayed process to prevent faster processes from completing operations on the shared data structure indefinitely
non blocking: guarantee that if there are one or more active processes trying to perform operations on a shared data structure, some operation will complete within a finite number of time steps

linearizable: An implementation of a data structure is linearizable if it can always
give an external observer, observing only the abstract data structure opera-
tions, the illusion that each of these operations takes effect instantaneously
at some point between its invocation and its response
